# Optimizing experimental design for spatial transcriptomics studies

Repository contents:
- `experiments/`: Contains code for experiments presented in the paper.
- `models/`: Contains code for more generalizable models used across the experimental design settings presented in the paper. For example, `nmc.py` contains code for running Nested Monte Carlo for optimizing the EIG objective.
- `tests/`: Tests for code correctness.
- `utils/`: Utility functions assisting with experimental design experiments.
